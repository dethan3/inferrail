# InferRail Pitch Narrative

## 1. Opening (15 seconds)

AI teams can buy inference from anyone online, but they still cannot trust delivery or payment.
InferRail solves this with an on-chain delivery-to-settlement rail.

## 2. Problem (30 seconds)

Today, outsourcing inference means:

- unclear commitments,
- weak proof of delivery,
- payment disputes.

This slows down collaboration and raises transaction risk.

## 3. Solution (45 seconds)

InferRail introduces a simple contract-driven workflow:

1. Publish job and lock funds.
2. Worker accepts and submits result proof.
3. Requester settles, or timeout rules trigger refund.

Every step is auditable on-chain.

## 4. Why Sui + Stablelayer (30 seconds)

- Sui provides efficient object state transitions for job lifecycle management.
- Stablelayer-oriented settlement keeps value stable and practical for service payments.

This is not a speculative token app; it is real payment infrastructure for AI work.

## 5. Demo Script (90 seconds)

- Create a new job with budget and deadline.
- Show escrow lock transaction.
- Accept job from worker wallet.
- Submit result URI + hash.
- Settle from requester wallet.
- Show timeline and final payout.
- Switch to timeout case and show refund path.

## 6. Judge-facing Value Statement

InferRail turns AI outsourcing from social trust into protocol trust.
That makes AI service collaboration faster, safer, and globally accessible.

## 7. Q and A Prepared Answers

Q: Is this just generic escrow?
A: No. It is purpose-built for inference delivery with structured result proof and lifecycle states.

Q: Why not launch a token?
A: Hackathon MVP prioritizes real utility and stable settlement over speculation.

Q: How is this useful after hackathon?
A: It can become a base settlement rail for agent-to-agent service markets and AI freelancer platforms.
